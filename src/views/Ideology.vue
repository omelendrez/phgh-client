          The modern world is bad. It is inhumane, unfair and unjust. This is the world of money. It is not for people. It is for those who produce this money, for bankers and financiers, government and millionaires. And people are mere "pawns" in this game. They just serve them as attendants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why do bankers work less and earn a hundred times more?
        </p>
        <p>
          What lies behind the social welfare? Labor. But why do bankers live a hundred times better than common people who really work hard? Do the bankers work harder? Definitely they don't! In addition they do not even produce any material values, as opposed to the workers. Why then the difference in income is so enormous?
        </p>
        <p>
          Many wonder with all sincerity now, reading this: "Well... a banker and a worker, they cannot be compared! The banker-the head of the Bank, he has power over money, and is well-connected. And we are ordinary people, having no power or clout. Naturally, the banker lives better than we do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, there is nothing "natural" here. The point is that everyone got used to this state of affairs and takes it as a matter of course. People believe that this is the way of the world, that a banker has to live better and it cannot be otherwise. But in reality things are different and the situation can be changed!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we move on to money. Of course, money is not any "measure of labor". These are fairy tales for idiots. Otherwise you would live like a lord. Or maybe you don’t work much enough? Unfortunately, money is just a tool to hold all of us in slavery. We are all slaves. Slaves of money. More precisely, we are slaves of those, who print money. They are our masters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, nothing has been changed at all during all these centuries on Earth. We have been living so far in the slave-owning system, which has undergone merely external transformations. Everything has become just more civilized and sophisticated. If anciently slaves had real shackles — rusty and steel, then today they are merely invisible, though they still exist. We don’t seem to have them, and can go wherever we want. There are no shackles, we are supposedly free! However, things are different. It is money that is our shackles in the modern world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice none of us is free. "Freedom" is an illusion. Money — that's the point! We are really nothing without money. We need a home, clothes, food and cannot live in a cave and even to go hunting, we need money now. It is necessary to have money everywhere! Because everything around us is just for money. You cannot make a single step without it! But where can we find money? Maybe to earn it?
          Have you ever wondered that it is immoral to trade yourself? That it is a kind of prostitution to sell your own strengths, brains, time... What is the difference from the trading of your own body? Well, but you will object that people have to work. If everybody would stop doing his job, what’s going to happen then?! We will resettle in cave again, won’t we?
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s ridiculous. The same "convincing" arguments could be heard for sure in the slave society, when the slaveholders had been trying to make understand their slaves, who, for some reason, didn’t want to work for them, and asked different questions. And later, the same arguments the landlords told their serfs clearly and confidently: "After all, if you stop working, what’s going to happen then?! Our society will collapse! And we will die of hunger!!!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, it is necessary to work, to create something useful for the society. Otherwise the society will degrade and die. But firstly, we have to work voluntarily, not for a bowl of soup and not only in order to survive; we have to do what we like!
        </p>
        <p>
          And secondly, while we are on the subject, once it is necessary to work — it is necessary for everyone. All people are equal, aren’t they? So let everybody work. The situation, when some people earn money (in the mines, at the factory, wasting their effort and health!) while others simply print it (sitting back and sipping an exotic cocktail), is abnormal. Such a situation is not acceptable in principle. And there are no "explanations" and excuses to this state of affairs. Absolutely!
        </p>
        <p>
          Money is just a paper, candy wrappers, which is not backed by anything tangible and, according to that, money is simply printed unrestrictedly, to anyone's heart's content. And then these candy wrappers are distributed among the slaves (among the likes of us) as "wages for labor". When we are given an extra wrapper (our salary is increased) — we are happy. Are you shocked? Alas, that's our bitter reality.
        </p>

          The whole financial world is a pyramid!
        </p>
        <p>
          How is the financial world organized? It is a pyramid. The Federal Reserve the U.S. Federal Reserve System is at the top of it. The Federal Reserve creates dollars. How much? As much as they want! Of course, Federal Reserve adhere to some of their own internal rules and regulations; they try, for example, not to create too many dollars to prevent complete devaluation of the currency, and etc. But in principle the Federal Reserve can create as many dollars as they want. At least, there are no any external limitations for that. Absolutely! The U.S. Federal Reserve is guided solely by the reasons of expediency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower levels of this global pyramid are the central banks of different countries; all other local national banks are situated on even lower levels. (Of course, all of this is slightly simplified, but in general everything reflects an overall picture). Actually, why do we need banks? Speaking figuratively, banks play the role of blood vessels in the social organism. Through these vessels the money (blood) from the heart (the Central Bank) enters all its organs. Money (blood) wash these organs, it brings life to them!.. Such an interesting comparison :-))
        </p>
        <p>
          New fair financial system will be established!
        </p>
        <p>
          Financial Apocalypse! That’s the only thing that can break our financial chains and save us all. Release us finally from the continuous slavery. Everything old will burn in its fire and the new will appear. The Federal Reserve will be removed from power and will no longer develop social inequality. The banks as they are now will simply disappear. They will stop robbing the people. In fact the banks do not produce anything useful. What useful thing can they do? Give credits at plundering interests? As a result all the population is burdened with debts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, modern banks were created for other purposes. They aren’t interested in the society but in their own goals. People aren’t important to them. Modern banks are loyal servants of the Federal Reserve, hypocritical agents, misusing the products of labor of common people. The current financial system is merely destroying us. And it will continue attacking us, and then our children and grandchildren. It will get even worse if nothing changes. We will destroy the existing financial system and build new — fair and honest! We have no other choice. We are not slaves. We are people. And we choose freedom!
        </p>
        <p>
          And this freedom is almost here already. Now, thanks to FITTOC financial Apocalypse is inevitable. Unavoidable! Since now it’s just the question of time. The seed has dropped. And it will grow. It’s already growing. Right now, at this moment! It will not perish!
        </p>
        <p>
          What does FITTOC stand for?
        </p>
        <p>
          FITTOC is a Global Mutual Aid Fund, World people's Bank, Financial Social Network — or any definition whatsoever. The point is not in the title. The bottom line is that this is a voluntary informal association of millions and millions of people throughout the Earth, rebelled against the financial slavery, chose to declare war against the Federal Reserve and banks. (And to win this war!!) And for this aim they have consolidated their capital — even though there are small amounts, owing to a great number, that is millions of people, it's already the power. Awesome and invincible power, growing every day!
        </p>
        <p>
          Well how do banks exist? Thanks to bankers? Billionaires? No, due to the same ordinary people who deposit their modest savings there. FITTOC takes the wind out of banks' sails making people see the reality. Why do the people bring their money to the banks at the exorbitant interests? Because they have no other choice. Banks are monopolists: there is no other place to bring money to. All banks are just the same, and controlled by the FEDERAL RESERVE. They simply destroy ordinary people.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we have an alternative — FITTOC! It’s something close to our hearts! Here people help each other. Today you help and tomorrow you will be helped. It’s the main principle of FITTOC. Do you really want bankers to buy another limousine or house for your money? You should not become another slave. Better join FITTOC and your money will help those who really need it! Poor people, retirees, disabled people…Woman with many children. Love thy neighbor! Help him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a kind of common storage box where people save their money and then take it when needed. The amount you need at the certain moment. (They do not steel but namely take money)!
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, people don’t need a lot of money. They need consciousness that they have it. Confidence in tomorrow’s day is what everybody really needs. It is just FITTOC that gives this confidence! It gives a feeling of partnership, that you aren’t alone! At the difficult moment you will never be abandoned but you will always be helped and supported! FITTOC is a unit of new society, brighter and better. New world, where there won’t be money. Current money. Where everything will be otherwise… Fair and honest. Where there won’t be any slaves or owners. Where everybody will work for their own pleasure and for the whole society. Where Good will defeat Evil! It will be so! There are no doubts!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to the System! Together we will change the world!
