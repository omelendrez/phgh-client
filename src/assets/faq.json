      "answer": "The idea of creating FITTOC as a global community of mutual aid is to further strengthen and fortify the journey of financial fairness that was started by Sergey Mavrodi by way of creating MMM.

In all we still give credit and honour to Sergey Mavrodi. FITTOC is based on his ideas but now with a better fair playing ground to all participants to avoid Hit and Run which will lead to Pause mode, Freeze mode and the eventual Restart of the system. FITTOC allows the Community to remain united and carry on its development. At the same time appreciates each member of the Community, their ideas and offers. Each active participant who shares the values of FITTOC can become a Guider/Leader and create his/her own structure."

      "question": "5. Does FITTOC act on legal grounds?",
      "answer": "FITTOC has no financial accounts and thus has no need in legal registration. FITTOC is the community, the social network, where people, who are willing to help each other voluntarily, can register and leave their contact information. Thus, the members of the FITTOC Community have no financial relationship with the Community itself, but only with each other. That is why FITTOC is not a subject of legal relations, and so the FITTOC Community cannot be illegal. With regard to the legality of its participants’ activity, it can be qualified as an act of gracious donation. Giving money by one participant to another one is not prohibited by either international or local legal systems. The right for gift giving — is one of the main forms of realization of the right for private property. FITTOC Community advocates for citizens’ strict observance of their countries’ legislation."

Access password in PO is sent to a participant after the registration. Logging in your PO and key transactions on funds withdrawal or change in account should be made only after SMS confirmation by the phone. The most frequently visited sections of the PO are Dashboard where you can find the information part of all operations, and “E-money”, where you can get acquainted with the current status and expected growth of the funds on your account. Particular attention should be paid to the accuracy of filling in the “Accounts” section. So that incompleteness or inaccuracy in bank details won’t cause any problems. In case of blocking of your PO due to violations of the Standards-rules, the only available operation remains is to contact support in order to learn the cause of the blockage and the conditions of unblocking if “it will be”."

      "question": "10. What is E-MONEY and how do they grow?",
      "answer": "E-money is a conventional unit for measurement of provided help to other participants in FITTOC. E-money can be credited in form of bonuses for activities such as promoting the community, referring new participants, assisting other participants in their needs. Actually E-money is a unit of measurement of participant’s contribution to the community. The more one contributes — the more E-money he gets. The amount of E-MONEY in the participant’s PO shows the maximum amount of help he can ask for. For example, if the participant has 100 E-MONEY, he can ask for 100-dollar help. The number of growing E-MONEY and progressive calculation of the amount of help can be seen directly in your PO in the section “E-money”. Attention! E-MONEY isn’t a currency, debt obligation or other form of financial assets. With E-MONEY, you can’t buy any goods or services.

    {
      "question": "12. How many times am I allowed to provide and get assistance?",
      "answer": "The number is unlimited. You can provide help even if you have already created “Get Help” request. However, having a multiple “Provide Help” means you can be matched to pay for all at the same time or nearly the same to avoid using one “Get-Help” to pay for multiple “Provide-Help”, you cannot activate more than one “Get Help” request at the same time. During this time, you also will not be able to make any changes in the section “My page” and “Accounts”, so you should check in advance the correctness of your data before sending the request for getting help."
    },
    {
      "question": "13. I have changed my password and now I have difficulties with making a “GET HELP” request. Why?",
      "answer": "If you decide to change the password to your Personal Office, a five-day moratorium on getting assistance (withdrawals) will be imposed on you. That is, within 5 days after the password has been changed, you won’t have the right to create a request for getting assistance. After the specified time is over, all your rights will be restored and you will be able to get help. This is done for security purposes to prevent hacking and stealing your account by frauds and hackers."

      "question": "14. Who are Guiders/Leaders?",
      "answer": " Guiders/Leaders are experienced and well-informed participants of the Community who consult and help the participants who they lead. Guiders/Leaders don’t have the right to demand the money to be transferred to any account. They just help the members of their unit feel confident in the Community and are responsible for the members whose direct guiders/leaders they are. Guiders/Leaders bonuses from the contributions made by the participants of their structures have a multilevel character (See the section on bonus programs WHAT IS FITTOC)."

    {
      "question": "15. Is one participant allowed to have several accounts?",
      "answer": "FITTOC is the Community where people trust and help each other. That’s why it uses a principle — “only one account for one person”. Accordingly, each participant should have own unique bank account or Bitcoin address. If you use the same Bitcoin address with other people it means you give them access to your money at any moment! If you are a beginner and still haven’t understood all functions of your Personal Office (PO) you can make your Guider/Leader your control confidant to help you with your account. Never share your PO email & password. It’s for your security to follow the descriptions below. In case when your account is blocked for the suspicious activity you should write to SUPPORT attaching the photo or scan of ID in order to confirm your identity. Besides, the CRO can request the video record explaining all the situation. In case the participant didn’t violate the standards-rules there’s nothing to worry about. He will be unblocked and the block won’t affect his E-MONEYs growth in any way. The absence of multi-accounts (when one person registers in the system several times) — is the key to dynamic and sustainable development of the Community in the future. The one who creates multiple accounts, and in this way tries to obtain additional, not provided in the standards-rules bonuses — deceives their colleagues and friends, fellow participants and in the end — themselves. Such frauds will be blocked once and for all and immediately expelled from our community! We need only honest people in the community who change the world for the better! "

    {
      "question": "16. Am I allowed to add several bank accounts and bitcoin addresses?",
      "answer": "In FITTOC System you are allowed to add several bank accounts to your personal office. However, note that these bank accounts have to be registered in the name of only one person — you. That is, the accounts must have the same name and surname. In that case, if you add to your office accounts that are registered in the names of different people, you are automatically recognized by the system as a fraud and will be blocked. It also refers to bitcoin address — the participant can have a few of them as well. You have the right to request assistance to be sent to any specified Bank or bitcoin address of yours. Yet it is prohibited to share your bank account and Bitcoin address with other people!"

    {
      "question": "17. How can I take part in the development of the FITTOC Community?",
      "answer": "Spreading FITTOC ideas and inviting new members to the Community is your additional contribution to the development of the Community. Nobody forces participants to invite beginners, however understanding that the Community exists due to the development pushes many participants to take active position. Simply invite and have 50 direct active referrals and become a Guider/Leader and hold seminars or home presentations, conduct charity actions or flash mobs, lead webinars and thematic blogs. Create your own large structure getting Referral and Guider/Leader’s bonuses for that. At the same time, you’ll make your own contribution to the development of the FITTOC Global"
